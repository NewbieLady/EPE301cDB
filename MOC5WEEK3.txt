I will set-up a plan to handle setbacks and failures if I get the promotion I want.
I can be who I really am at work and will learn how to get along with others that may not have the same views as me.
I should show interest in any new projects at work that appeal to me.
I will focus on making an effort to deliver great results for all of my work projects within the allotted work hours.
I will contribute at meetings when I have something valuable to add, knowing that my opinion matters.
